// prettier-ignore
// MIND READER

// FUNCTIONALITIES

// Has 6 pages

// Each page should be a unique function within an object

// Each page shares a navigator at the bottom that allows the user to cycle through them

// The navigator remembers which page you are on and displays it

// Has the ability to go back home or one page up or one page down

// HOW TO MAKE THESE FUNCTIONALITIES WORK

// Have a central storage for each page held within functions (probably an object)

// the navigation functions will have 3 functionalities buttons forward backwards or home

// Forward function will take **what page were currently on** and increment it by 1

// Backward function wil take **what page were currently on** and decrement it by 1

// Home function will set **the page were currently on** to 1

// Each page has a CTA either Go, next, reveal that are buttons that will call the forward function

// Each page besides the first will have a home button that will call teh home function
